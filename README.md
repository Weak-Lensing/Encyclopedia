# The Euclid Weak Lensing Encyclopedia

  Weak lensing is an effect where the images of distant galaxies are
  distorted by the gravitational potential caused by matter
  perturbations along the line of sight. It is a method that majority
  of wide-field imaging surveys are, or will, use to determine
  cosmological parameters through the dependency of this effect on the
  geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure. It is also an
  effect that can be observed around galaxy clusters and individual
  galaxies, and used to make maps of the gravitational potential and
  inferred matter density. Weak lensing studies, as a sub-field of
  cosmology, contain significant specialised terms and definitions
  that are used commonly throughout the weak lensing literature. In
  this document we provide a reference for some of those specialised terms in
  an easily referenceable manner, as well as commonly used terms that
  have a special meaning in weak lensing studies. This document is a live
  document that will be updated in response to community input that can be
  submitted here https://github.com/Weak-Lensing/Encyclopedia/issues as issues.
