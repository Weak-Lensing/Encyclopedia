The angular-diameter distance $D_{\rm A}$ to a source is defined as
the square root of the ratio of its physical surface area $\d A$ and the solid angle $\d\omega$ it subtends on the observer's sky, $D_{\rm A}=\sqrt{\d A/\d \omega}$. In general, the angular-diameter distance is affected by the tidal gravitational field along the line-of-sight, leading to (isotropic) focusing or anisotropic shearing of the light bundle. For a homogeneous, isotropic universe, the angular-diameter distance is a function of the cosmological redshift of a source. {\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Friedman--Robertson--Walker Models}}.

\newcommand\HaloModel{
A Halo Model is one that describes the of distribution of dark matter around galaxies on large scales. 
The main assumption of a halo model is that all matter resides in halos i.e. distinct clouds of dark matter. 
The main ingredients of a halo model are an average halo density profile $\rho(r)$, a halo 
mass function $n(M, z)$ that describes the number of halos as a function of mass and redshifts, 
a halo bias $b_{\rm h}(M, z)$ function that relates the number of galaxies to the number of dark matter haloes 
as a function of mass and redshift, and how halos cluster together in 
the form of the two-point correlation functions $\xi_{\rm h}(r)$ or power spectra as a function of seperation; 
as well as higher-order correlations and correction. The halo model has been applied to describe the 
distribution of dark matter, e.g. \cite{2003MNRAS.341.1311S} and \cite{2012ApJ...761..152T}, and also has been 
extended to include the distribution of the baryonic component in the Universe and the interaction between 
this baryonic component and the dark matter e.g. \cite{2014JCAP...04..028F}, \cite{2011MNRAS.417.2020S} and

A density profile describes how the density of the distribution of matter changes as a function of radial

There exists three commonly used models for dark matter density profiles that are used in weak lensing. 
All assume a spherically symmetric mass distribution with the follow functional forms for the density of

\ee
%
where $\rho_o$ is the central density and $r_c$ is the core radius. This model is a good fit to most rotation curve data, but is only an approximation. 

\item NFW (Navarro-Frenk-White) profile \citep{NFW} is defined as 
%
\be
\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_c \delta_c}{(1/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^2}\;,
\tag{DP.2}

where $r_s$ is a scale radius, $\delta_c$ is a characteristic density, and $\rho_c$ is the critical over density defined as $\rho_c=3H^2/8\pi G$. The NFW profile works for a large range of halo masses and sizes, from individual galaxies to the halos of galaxy clusters. 

\item Einasto profile (investigated in \cite{2006AJ....132.2685M}) is defined as

  particular interest in weak lensing because the mass distribution
  inferred from weak and strong lensing measurements is offset from
  the distribution of the hot intracluster gas; and spatially
  coincident with the distribution of cluster galaxies. This offset is thought to be due to
  the collision between the clusters where the dark matter did not
  interact but the X-ray emitting gas did -- causing a shock

Here $\chi$ is the distance of a comoving position $(f_{\rm K}(\chi)\vec\theta,\chi)$ from the observer, 
and $\vec\theta$ is the line-of-sight direction relative to a fiducial direction. The 
approximation assumes that the random field quickly decorrelates such that 
correlations between positions with different radial distances from the observer can effectively be 
evaluated at the same $\chi$. For example, it assumes for a two-point correlation function that

Importantly, the Limber approximation assumes small angular separations on the sky, or large angular wave 
numbers in the case of power spectra \citep{2007A&A...473..711S}.  Thereby we arrive at the following 
integral for the angular two-point correlation function $C_{12}(\theta)$ of homogeneous and isotropic random fields $\delta$. For this let

 g_i(\vec\theta)=

%
be projections $i$ of $\delta$ on the sky along $\vec\theta$ with projection kernel $q_i(\chi)$. The Limber approximation then yields for the cross correlation between $g_i(\vec\theta)$ and $g_j(\vec\theta^\prime)$ the integral

C_{ij}(\theta)=

cosmic shear studies, their dark matter environments may be different which can be inferred using galaxy-galaxy lensing studies. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Early-type galaxies are elliptical galaxies which have approximately spheroidal systems. They usually

\item Late-type galaxies are spiral galaxies which have disc systems. They usually have blue colours 
optical wavelengths and are hypothesised to have rotation-supported stellar systems. Irregular galaxies also fall into this category.

For weak gravitational lensing, the light profile and substructure might need to be taken into 
account when measuring shapes because the bias in estimators of galaxy shapes usually depend, 
among other things, on the light profile. A model for the radial light profile of a galaxy

hosting an AGN at its nucleus is called an `active' galaxy.
Observationally, an AGN is often difficult to distinguish from a
central star burst. Physically, the radiation from an AGN is not due
to the stars or hot gas in the galaxy, but powered by accretion of
matter onto a supermassive black hole at the centre of its host
galaxy. AGNs are classified into different categories: Seyfert
galaxies, radio galaxies, quasars, QSOs, and BL Lac Objects

relevant for weak lensing because they affect the
distribution of matter through baryonic feedback processes
{\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Baryonic Feedback}} that occur during the formation and
evolution of galaxies. Furthermore, if the luminosity of an AGN is
sufficiently large, it can outshine the radiation of its host galaxy

spectral information or multi-band imaging can be used to remedy this.

The colour-absolute magnitude diagram of low-redshift galaxies shows a
distinctive pattern. If the colour is measured in two bands, located
on either side of the $4000\AA$ break, then a concentration of red
galaxies at high luminosities, and one of blue galaxies at lower
luminosities is seen. Most of the luminous galaxies belong to one of
these two concentrations, constituting the {\it red sequence} and {\it
  blue cloud} of galaxies; the space between these two
concentration in the colour-magnitude diagram is called {\it green
  valley}, but it is populated with only a small fraction of galaxies
\citep[see, e.g.,][]{2009ARA&A..47..159B}. There is a strong
correlation between the galaxy colours and their morphological
classification, in that most blue-cloud galaxies are spirals, whereas
the majority of red-sequence galaxies are early-type galaxies
(ellipticals and S0's), or early-type spirals. The blue and red
populations of galaxies appears to also extend to higher redshift. The
importance of the distinction between red and blue galaxies for weak
lensing comes from their different intrinsic alignment properties and
the difficulty to perform a morphological classification for galaxies
with the apparent magnitudes typical for weak lensing source galaxies:
red-sequence galaxies seem to have considerably higher intrinsic
alignment amplitudes than blue-cloud galaxies \citep[see, e.g.,][and

A colour gradient is a spatially varying spectral energy distribution

important potential systematic effect in weak lensing, because it is necessary to measure galaxy shapes with great accuracy, 
which in turn requires a detailed model of the 
point spread function (PSF). In general, the PSF varies with wavelength and therefore the PSF integrated over an 
observing filter depends on the spectrum of the object. For a typical galaxy the spectrum varies across the galaxy image, 
thus the PSF depends on the position within the image. Therefore colour gradients within galaxies can nessitate a position-dependent 
PSF correction to be applied when measuring the shapes of galaxies. This effect has been investigated in

  `traps' in the pixel and is left behind during transfer of that
  pixel to the readout amplifier. The fraction of charge lost depends
  on the signal levels of both the source and the background. Since in
  a CCD, charge must be transferred many times before reaching the
  readout register, even a small decrease in CTE can have a large
  effect on the measured count rate near the centre of the
  detector. For $n$ transfers, the fraction of detected charge will be
  $\textrm{CTE}^n$.  Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) measures the
  loss; i.e. CTI = 1 - CTE. Most of the charge lost during a transfer
  will reappear during a later transfer, which causes `charge tails'
  away from the sources towards the read-out register. These trails impact photometry, noise, shape and
  astrometry of sources. CTI trails result in the following problems;
\begin{enumerate}
\item They remove flux from the central pixel, hence degrading the expected S/N for an observation; 
\item They bias measurements of sources along the trail, impacting astrometry; 
\item CTI from warm pixels and cosmic rays introduce noise in observations.
\end{enumerate}
For a space-based telescope, CTE degrades over time, as the
bombardment by 
energetic particles generate more defects in the lattice structure of the CCDs. 
The impact of CTE, or CTI, on weak lensing has been investigated in 
\cite{2007ApJS..172..203R,2010PASP..122..439R,2010MNRAS.401..371M,2010MNRAS.409L.109M,2014MNRAS.439..887M,2015MNRAS.453..561I}.

\newcommand\Dither{
A technique that consists of slightly moving the telescope between `exposures', i.e. within each slew. One purpose of `dithering' 
is to reduce some types of CCD sensor noise such as pattern noise. A relatively standard method is to randomly move the 
telescope, known as random dithering. Dithering causes the resultant image to land on a different sets of pixels from one dither to the next. 

The advantage of dithering is chip artefacts can be minimised when the different `sub' exposures are combined. 
The best signal-to-noise ratio improvement that can be achieved, without data smoothing, is the mean combine.  
For $n$ frames, a mean combine, improves signal-to-noise by $\sqrt{n}$. 
However a mean combine does nothing to eliminate artefacts, except by reducing their visibility by $1/n$.  
A median combine improves signal-to-noise by $\sqrt{2n/3}$, or about $20\%$ less than the mean but does 
reduce some artefacts. Another combine method is MMClip\footnote{\url{http://www.hiddenloft.com/notes/dithering.htm}}

The Fisher (information) matrix is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable, or random variable,

In cosmology and weak lensing, the Fisher matrix is generally used to determine the sensitivity of a 
particular survey to a set of parameters and has been used largely 
for forecasting and optimisation. It is defined as the ensemble
average of the \textit{curvature} of the likelihood function

Its inverse is an approximation of the covariance matrix of the parameters, by analogy with a 
Gaussian distribution in the $\theta_{\alpha}$, for
which is exact --- this was investigated for CMB in \citep{1997ApJ...480...22T}. 
Therefore, using the assumption of Gaussianity in the data, it allows us to 
estimate the errors on parameters without
having to cover the whole parameter space. The authors of \cite{BJK} have compared
the Fisher matrix analysis with the full likelihood function analysis
and found there was great agreement between the two methods if the

local variations of the potential field and hence can in principle probe small and non-linear scales. 
In application there are several systematics that need to be overcome \cite{2006MNRAS.365..414B}, for example

It should, ideally, be represented by one number or metric. In weak lensing studies and cosmology, FoMs have been defined as 
some function of the Fisher matrix of the parameters of interest. Some example are:

trace of the Fisher matrix (or its $\log$) and is proportional to
sum of the variances. This prefers a spherical error region, but may
not necessarily select the smallest volume.

the inverse of the square of the parameter volume enclosed by the

In mathematics, in the field of functional analysis, a Minkowski functional is a function that recovers a notion 
of distance on a linear space. In cosmology, they are the main tools to characterise the large-scale galaxy 
distribution in the Universe. A tutorial on the use of Minkowki Functionals in cosmology is provided by \cite{1996dmu..conf..281S}. 
In weak lensing Minkowski functionals may be used to test modified gravity 
theories \citep{2015PhRvD..91j3511P,2014ApJ...786...43S,2013PhRvD..88l3002P}.

This is the imitation of the operation of a process or system over time, such as the Universe. 
Numerical simulations play a significant role in cosmology. The first simulations started in 1960s and 1970s 
\citep{1963MNRAS.126..223A,1970AJ.....75...13P,1974ApJ...187..425P}. The important factors that should be 
taken into account for simulations are 1) setting the initial conditions, 2) setting the equations of evolution of 
fluctuations that were set in the initial conditions. Some of the simulations of the Universe include\\
1. Millennium \url{https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/}\\
2. Illustris \url{http://www.illustris-project.org} \\
3. EAGLE \url{http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/}.\\
Simulations are also extensively used to capture the complexity of different steps in the 'end-to-end' 
pipelines in different experiments. For example, to estimate cosmological parameters, simulations are used to 
estimate the covariance matrix. Simulations are also used to test different methods and algorithms available 
before taking data in experiments. See e.g. \cite{2000astro.ph..5502K} for a review. 
Simulations of the imaging process in weak lensing can also be performed.

zero radius and the fact that the total mass calculated by integrating the function out to infinite radius 
does not converge (i.e., it is infinite). However, it is commonly utilised in the literature due to the simplicity of its form.
In lensing, SIS is one of the simplest axially symmetric analytical models to describe the matter distribution of 
extended lenses. The main advantage of using axially symmetric lenses is that their surface density 
is independent on the position angle with respect to lens centre and this reduces the lensing equations a 
one-dimensional form.

A series of functions defined on the surface of a sphere used to solve some kinds of differential equations. 
They are similar to Fourier transform, but operate on the surface of a sphere. Spherical 
harmonics are defined as the angular portion of a set of solutions to Laplace's equation in three dimensions. Represented 
in a system of spherical coordinates with $\theta$ and $\phi$, Laplace's spherical harmonics $Y_\ell^m$ are 
a specific set of spherical harmonics that forms an orthogonal system, first introduced 
by Pierre Simon de Laplace in 1782. They form a complete orthonormal set on the unit sphere and are defined as

Y_\ell^m = \sqrt{\frac{2\ell + 1}{4\pi} \frac{(l-m)!}{(l + m)!}} P_\ell^m(\cos\theta)e^{im\phi} \; ,

The order $m$ ranges as $-\ell \le m \le \ell$ and $P_\ell^m$ are the Legendre polynomials. Spherical harmonics 
are important in cosmology for representation of gravitational fields, planetary bodies and 
stars, and characterisation of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In weak lensing 
the cosmic shear field can be described using spherical harmonics supplemented by a radial Bessel function transform,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\dictentry{dictionary}{Spin}{\Spin}
\newcommand\Spin{
In quantum mechanics and particle physics, spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried 
by elementary particles, composite particles (hadrons), and atomic nuclei. The conventional definition of 
the spin quantum number is $s = n/2$, where n can be any non-negative integer. 
Hence the allowed values of $s$ are $0,\; 1/2,\; 1,\; 3/2,\; 2$, etc.

Parallels are used in weak lensing where the shearing of images of objects is a spin-2 field, meaning under 
a rotation of $\pi$ in the coordinate system the field is left unchanged. A rotation by $\pi/2$ 
changes $\gamma_1$ to $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_2$ to $-\gamma_1$. A rotation of counterclockwise 
$\phi$ changes $(\gamma_1 + i \gamma_2) \rightarrow  (\gamma_1 + i\gamma_2) \exp(-2i\phi)$; see e.g.  
\cite{2015RPPh...78h6901K}. 
The weak lensing ellipticity 
field is therefore a spin-2 field, which is locally symmetric under 180 degree transformations, whereas the 
convergence field is a spin-0 field (i.e. a scalar).

the regime where the effect of gravitational lensing is very small, with both the 
convergence and the shear much smaller than unity. Therefore, $\gamma$ is a good approximation of $g$ to linear order.

\dictentry{dictionary}{Redshift z}{\Redshift}
\newcommand\Redshift{
Redshift quantifies the amount by which the light from a distant object, such as a galaxy, 
is moved to the redder end of the spectrum. Galaxies have redshifts caused by 
the expansion of the Universe. The redshift is defined by 
\setcounter{equation}{0}

z= \frac{a(t_{\rm obs})}{a(t_{\rm emit})}-1

\label{eq:ZZ.2}
\ee
%
where $a(t)$ are the scale factors at the cosmic time $t$ (the proper time measured 
by an observer at rest to the local matter distribution, or `substratum'). 
Because, by convention, $a(t_{\rm obs}) = 1$ the redshift is usually related to the 
scale factor simply by $a = (1 + z)^{-1}$. For local galaxies the redshift is related to the apparent 
recessional velocity by $z\approx v/c$, where $v$ is the recessional velocity and $c$ is the speed of light in 
vacuum. Note that local galaxies could have a redshift (or a blueshift) due to their local peculiar velocity.

\dictentry{dictionary}{Monte Carlo}{\MonteCarlo}
\newcommand\MonteCarlo{
Refers to a process in which samples are chosen randomly from some distribution. A common example is a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain used to sample a probability distribution where at each step in the chain a sample is drawn randomly from some `proposal' distribution. However this phrase is used more colloquially to mean any random sample, for example ``just Monte-Carlo it'' would be a suggestion to run the process in question many times where each time a random set of variables in question are chosen. 

Monte Carlo methods/experiments/simulations are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other mathematical methods. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimisation, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are quite useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom.
In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is too complex, mathematicians often use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary probability distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler

\newcommand\PCA{
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. The principal components are orthogonal because they are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which is symmetric. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.
PCA can be done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data covariance (or correlation) matrix or singular value decomposition of a data matrix, usually after mean centering (and normalizing or using Z-scores) the data matrix for each attribute.

The covariance/Fisher matrix is a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix and therefore, can be diagonalised
using its eigenvectors. This has the form $\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{E^{T}}\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{E}$,$\;$where
$\mathbf{C}$ is the covariance matrix, $\mathbf{{\normalcolor E}}$
is an orthogonal matrix with the eigenvectors of ${\normalcolor \mathbf{C}}$
as its rows and ${\normalcolor \mathbf{\Lambda}}$ is the diagonal
matrix with the eigenvalues of ${\normalcolor \mathbf{C}}$ as its
diagonal elements%
\footnote{It is common to construct the covariance matrix for PCA. However,
the Fisher matrix can be used instead; the eigenvectors stay the same, but
eigenvalues are reciprocals.%

the original parameters ${\normalcolor \mathbf{O}}$, through the eigenvectors

The $X_{i}$ are called the \emph{principal components} of the experiment
and are ordered so that so that $X_{1}$ has the smallest
eigenvalue and $X_{n}$ the largest. In this construction, the eigenvalues
are the variances of the new parameters, so $X_{1}$ and $X_{n}$ are the best- and worst-measured components respectively. The eigenvectors have
been normalised so that $\sum_{j}e_{j}^{2}=1$, where $e_{j}$ are
the elements of $E_{i}$. We list some properties of PCA below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The main point of PCA is to assess the degeneracies (correlations) amongst the parameters
that are not resolved by the experiments, be they fundamental as from 
cosmic variance or due to the noise and coverage of the experiment.
In our case, it will especially help us to see the correlation amongst
the bins of the primordial PS, and between the bins and the cosmological
parameters.
\item The eigenvalues obtained measure the performance of the experiment
--- a larger number of small eigenvalues means a better experiment.
Another measure of the performance of the experiments is to see how
they mix physically independent parameters such as, say, $n_{s}$,
the spectral index, and $\Omega_{b}$. This sort of mixture may be
improved by improving the experiment's noise properties or increasing its area or volume.%
\footnote{However, the so-called `geometrical degeneracy'
cannot be improved by improving the experiments; two models with
same primordial PS, the same matter content, and the same comoving
distance to the surface of last scattering produce identical CMB PS.%

\dictentry{dictionary}{Quantum Efficiency}{
Quantum efficiency (QE) measures the effectiveness of a CCD to produce electronic charge when hit by incident photons; the percentage of photons that are actually detected (due to photoelectrons being produced) is known as the Quantum Efficiency (QE). For example, the human eye only has $\rm{QE}\simeq20\%$, a photographic film has $\rm{QE}\simeq10\%$. QE is wavelength dependent and it directly effects the $S/N$ of the CCD. Hence a CCD is generally chosen which has the highest QE in the desired wavelength range. The key factor in determining the QE of a CCD is the actual structure of the CCD. In Euclid CCDs, the QE range from $\rm{QE}\simeq50\%$ at wavelength $\lambda=900$ to $\rm{QE}\simeq90\%$ at wavelength $\lambda=750$.

\newcommand\slew{A slew is the rotation of a spacecraft from one pointing direction to another. Generally this

this may refer to HST or Euclid missions. For Euclid this refers to a rotation of $0.7$ times the field-of-view, i.e. approximately the field of view of the instruments or more, and it entails the reaquisition of the knowledge of the pointing direction at its termination using an on-satellite star catalog. 

A dither is a smaller rotation, with pointing directions within-field, and sometimes as small as arc seconds. Knowledge of the pointing direction is generally maintained during the dither. Dithers are used to maximise the utility of multiple exposures, by moving the image with respect to the detector pixel grids, to recover spatial resolution in slightly under-sampled images. In the Euclid context the multiple exposures themselves (as opposed to the re-pointings) are often also called dithers, but the meaning is generally clear from the context. {\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Dither}}.

\dictentry{dictionary}{Brighter-Fatter Effect}{\bfe}
\newcommand\bfe{This is an effect in which the profile of point
  sources ({\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{PSF}}) as recorded on the detector is flattened 
and broadened to an extent depending on the flux recorded by a CCD detector 
(the effect is negligible in HeCdTe detectors used in the infrared). 

Within a CCD pixel, as absorbed photons with sufficient energy elevate
electrons into the conduction band of the Silicon, they collect in the
potential well created by the voltage applied to the electrodes. In
back-illuminated CCDs such as the CCD273 in Euclid, photons are
absorbed in a region between the back surface and the electrodes (the pixel boundaries are set by the field structure extending from the electrodes to the back surface). The accumulation of charge changes the
field structure, with the consequence that it modifies the effective
boundaries of the pixel. If its neighbouring pixels are collecting
fewer photons, this effectively reduces its size as the charge
accumulates. When remapped to a regular grid in which all pixel areas
are the same, as in an image, this pixel appears to be slightly
deficient in charge, and the neighbours appear to have excess
charge. The point-source profile is therefore flattened at the peak
and broadened, with a dependence on the overall photon flux captured
in the exposure.

The impact of this effect on weak lensing has been studied in \cite{2015ExA....39..207N,2015JInst..10C5032G,2015JInst..10C5015W}.

\dictentry{dictionary}{Pocket Pumping}{\ppp}
\newcommand\ppp{Pocket pumping is a technique which is used to identify damage in the Si lattice in CCD detectors. Ions, generally Solar protons, but also heavier ions from the Sun and of cosmic origin, incident on the detector may displace atoms in the lattice, especially in areas where there impurities and the lattice is less elastic. These regions are called traps, because as the CCD is being read out at the end of an exposure, electrons in the conduction band may be trapped in the local irregularity. Several species of trap exist, with different trapping and release time constants. Traps with longer release time constants than the readout rate may release their trapped electrons into a subsequent pixel, giving rise to a trail behind the image. This directly modifies the shape of the image, which is important for measuring its shape, and must be corrected for weak gravitational lensing measurements. When pocket pumping, the charge is shuffled backwards and forwards without being read out during the exposure. If the shuffling frequency is resonant with the trap release time, charges in a pixel will be trapped and released in the adjacent pixel, so that an initially uniform image develops bright-faint pairs. These pairs identify the location of each trap with that associated trap release time constant. The shuffling frequency can then be changed to explore another species of trap in the next pocket pumping exposure. The initial uniform image can be generated by the artificial injection of charge 
or by optical illumination, for example in the case of Euclid, by a calibration source.

\item Log-normal Distribution

This is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed --- a log-normally distributed random variable can only take positive real values. For data $x$, where $\log(x)$ has normal distribution
%
\be
\ln \mathcal{N} \left(x;\mu,\sigma^2 \right)=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}x^2 \right)^{1/2}\exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(\ln x-\mu\right)^{2}}  {\sigma^{2}}\right] \;\;\;\;\;\; {\rm for} \;\; x>0 \;.

For $x_{n}$ is drawn from `standard' normal distribution, then $X=\sum_{n}^{N}x_{n}^{2}$ has a $\chi^{2}$ distribution with $N$ degrees of freedom
%
\be
\chi_{N}^{2}\left(X\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2^{N}\Gamma^{2}\left(N/2\right)}\right)^{1/2}X^{N/2-1}\exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2}X\right] \ ,

where $\Gamma(N/2)$ is Gamma function. If $x_{n}$ has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$ then $X=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\sum_{n}^{N}\left(x_{n}-\mu\right)^2$ has a $\chi^{2}$ distribution with $\left(N-1\right)$ degrees of freedom.

\item Poisson Distribution 

This probability distribution describes the distribution of a discrete independent point process
%
\be
\mathcal{P}_n = \frac{\lambda^n}{n} \exp{(-\lambda)} \; ,
\tag{PD.6}
\label{eq:PD.6}

where $\lambda$ is the average number of events per interval (e.g. in a volume of space), $n$ is the event (e.g. a galaxy). 
This is useful in weak lensing and cosmology because many processes have Poisson distribution for example 
photon noise.

%%%%%%%%
\item Wishart Distribution

For $x$ being an $N\times p$ matrix, with each row being independently drawn from a $p$-variate normal distribution with mean $\mu=0$, 
the $p\times p$ random scatter matrix $\mathbf{S}=X^TX$ has a Wishart distribution with $N$ degrees of freedom and covariance $\mathbf{C}$
%
\be
\mathcal{W}_p \left(\mathbf{C},N\right) = \frac{1}{2^{Np/2} \left|\mathbf{C}\right|^{N/2} \Gamma_p \left(N/2\right)}
\left|S\right|^{(N-p-1)/2}
\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\textrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{S}\right)\right]\; ,
\tag{PD.7}
\label{eq:PD.7}
\ee
%
where $\Gamma_p$ is the multivariate Gamma function. 
In cosmology and weak lensing, this distribution is useful because parameters covariance matrices have Wishart distributions.
 The Wishart distribution is the multivariate extension of the gamma distribution --- in case of integer degrees of freedom, 
it is a multivariate generalisation of the $\chi^2$distribution; i.e. for a single data point ($p=1$), 
the Wishart distribution is the reduced $\chi^2$-distribution. As the $\chi^2$distribution describes the sums 
of squares of $N$ draws from a univariate normal distribution, the Wishart distribution represents the sums 
of squares (and cross-products) of $N$ draws from a multivariate normal distribution. For examples of the use of this distribution in 
weak lensing see \cite{2013MNRAS.432.1928T,2014IAUS..306...99J}.

\item Inverse Wishart Distribution

For $x$ being an $N\times p$ matrix, with each row being independently drawn from a $p$-variate normal distribution with mean $\mu=0$, 
the $p\times p$ random scatter matrix $\mathbf{S}=X^TX$ (note that this is the inverse of $\mathbf{S}$ in Wishart distribution) has a inverse Wishart distribution with $N$ degrees of freedom and covariance $\mathbf{C}$
%
\be
\mathcal{W}^{-1}_p\left(\mathbf{C},N\right) = \frac{1}{2^{Np/2}\left|\mathbf{S}\right|^{N+p+1/2}\Gamma_p \left(N/2 \right)}
\left| \mathbf{C} \right|^{N/2}
\exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\textrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{S}^{-1}\right)\right]\; ,
\tag{PD.8}
\label{eq:PD.8}
\ee
%
where $\Gamma_p$ is the multivariate Gamma function. 
In cosmology, they are useful as normally parameters precision matrices (inverse of covariance matrices) have inverse Wishart distributions. 
The Inverse-Wishart distribution is the multivariate extension of the inverse-gamma distribution --- in case of integer degrees of 
freedom, it is a multivariate generalisation of the inverse $\chi^2-$distribution; i.e. for a single data point ($p=1$), the 
inverse Wishart distribution is the inverse $\chi^2$ distribution. For examples of the use of this distribution in
weak lensing see \cite{2013MNRAS.432.1928T,2014IAUS..306...99J}

\item Marsaglia-Tin Distribution

A probability density function (PDF) for ratios of two random Gaussian variables with arbitrary means and correlation. 
This was first discussed in \cite{Marsaglia:1965:RNV} and \cite{10.2307/2283154}. This distribution is encountered 
in weak lensing, as estimating the ellipticity of a galaxy involves a ratio of  
such variables. For example, the ellipticity can be estimated using the semi-major and semi-minor axis of the galaxy shape 
$\epsilon = [(a-b)/(a + b)] \exp(2i\phi)$. The Marsaglia-Tin distribution was further generalised 
by \cite{Viola01042014} to the case of two ratios constructed from three correlated random variables, which is relevant 
for ellipticity measurements.

Ellipticity defines the 2D shape of an object, hence it is a spin-2 quantity which is usually defined as a complex quantity. The symbol $e$ is generically used, which could be ellipticity, polarisation or shear. In a two-dimensional (flat-sky) Cartesian coordinate system the real (imaginary) part of $e$ can be identified with the first (second) coordinate in that system, usually written as $e=e_1+{\rm i}e_2$; where $e_1$ is called {\it Ellipticity-1} and $e_2$ is called {\it Ellipticity-2}.

Both of these are measurements of ellipticity. 
In the case of weak lensing, when we compute the average ellipticity over an ensemble of galaxies whose orientations 
are assumed to be random, we find that:
%
\be
\left\langle\epsilon\right\rangle \simeq \frac{\left\langle\chi\right\rangle}{2}\simeq g \simeq \gamma\;,
\tag{EO.3}

%
where $g=\gamma/(1-\kappa)$ is the reduced shear. Therefore, either definition of ellipticity, 
under the assumptions outlined above, is taken to be an unbiased noisy estimate 
of the gravitational shear at the location of the galaxy. 
In practice, the observed, measured ellipticity will be convolved with a telescope (and possibly atmospheric) 
point spread function (PSF) which convolves the image and has the effect of smearing the galaxy images. 
This impacts the measured ellipticity:
%
\be
\chi^{o} = \frac{\chi + T\chi^{\rm PSF}}{1+T}\;,
\tag{EO.4}
\label{eq:EO.4}
\ee

where $\chi$ is the lensed galaxy ellipticity prior to convolution with the PSF, $\chi^{\rm PSF} $ 
is the ellipticity of the point spread function, $\chi^{o}$ is the measured, observed ellipticity of the galaxy after convolution with the PSF and 
%
\be
T = \frac{P_{11} + P_{22}}{Q_{11}+Q_{22}}.
\tag{EO.5}
\label{eq:EO.5}

In the above equation, $P_{ij}$ refers to the 2nd order moments of the PSF and $Q_{ij}$ refers to 
the 2nd order moments of the galaxy's brightness distribution, as before.

Gravitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing challenges are a series of challenges, with a goal of testing and facilitating the development of methods within the lensing community for analysing astronomical data in a blind way to find the best methods to measure weak gravitational lensing. So far there has been GREAT08, GREAT10 and GREAT3 each with different aims and challenges;
\begin{itemize}
\item The GREAT8 Challenge set a highly simplified version of the problem, using known PSFs, simple galaxy models, 
and a constant applied gravitational shear \citep{2009AnApS...3....6B,2010MNRAS.405.2044B}.
\item The GREAT10 Challenge increased the realism and complexity of its simulations over GREAT08 
by using cosmologically-varying shear fields and greater variation in galaxy model parameters and 
telescope observing conditions. Since imperfect knowledge of the PSF can also bias shear measurements, 
GREAT10 tested also PSF modelling in a standalone Star Challenge \citep{2010arXiv1009.0779K,2012MNRAS.423.3163K,2013ApJS..205...12K}.
\item The GREAT3\footnote{\url{http://www.great3challenge.info}} 
challenge included effects realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from space; 
spatially varying and physically-motivated blurring kernel; and combination of multiple different 
exposures \citep{2014ApJS..212....5M,2015MNRAS.450.2963M}.

In \cite{DETF} the Dark Energy Task Force defined several different levels of dark energy experiments in order to rank their relative capabilities. 
The ranking was done using their defined Figure of Merit (FoM) which is the inverse of the area of the predicted 
$68\%$ confidence region for an experiment in the $(w_0,w_a)$ plane. This is commonly approximated in the 
majority of the literature by using a Fisher matrix where

cosmological parameters. 
The dark energy stages were divided into four categories, where a Stage I experiment 
was the least constraining experiment and Stage IV was the most constraining. 
As of 2006, these stages were defined in \cite{DETF} as 
\begin{enumerate}

Stage I represents what is now known.

Stage II represents the anticipated state of knowledge upon completion of
ongoing projects that are relevant to dark energy.

Stage IV comprises a Large Survey Telescope (LST), and/or the Square
Kilometer Array (SKA), and/or a Joint Dark Energy (Space) Mission (JDEM).

A mixing matrix is a matrix that encodes the correlation introduced by missing data in azimuthal

where $\ell$ and $\ell'$ are angular wavenumber --- {\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{l-mode}}. It is also 
referred to as the `mode-mode coupling matrix'. 
Referring to \cite{2011MNRAS.412...65H} the harmonic transform of an angular mask $K(\hat n)$ as a function of angle $\hat n$ is

in latitude and longitude projected onto the sky. The covariance, or correlation, of the mask is given by 
${\mathcal K}_{\ell\ell'}\equiv [1/(2\ell+1)]\sum_m K_{\ell m}K^*_{\ell m}$. For an isotropic spin-2 field the 
spherical harmonic transforms are spin-2 functions and $m$ is integrated over. 
In this case aliasing of the E-mode and B-mode correlation functions are 
both affected by an angular mask, and the resulting $E$-mode mixing matrix is defined as

mass as being on a 2D plane along the line of sight where the deflection of light occurs instantaneously when the light 
ray intersects the plane. This is assummed to be a good approximation if the extent of the lensing mass in comoving 
distance is much smaller than the comoving distance between the observer and the lens, and the lens and source -- which 
is the case in the majority of gravitational lens systems. Several studies have tested the validity of this approximation

An observed ellipticity for an individual galaxy is written like

where $\epsilon^{\rm int}$ is the unlensed `intrinsic' ellipticity of a galaxy, $\gamma$ is the
weak lensing shear. The intrinsic part is labelled $I$ and the shear part is labelled $G$. 
Assuming that the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies do not have a random orientation or phase, one can take the correlation 
function of the observed ellipticity 
%

\langle \epsilon^{\rm int}_i\epsilon^{*, \rm int}_j\rangle+

where $i$ and $j$ label different redshifts. The four terms on the right hand side are given the abbreviations 
II, IG, GI, and GG. In the context of power spectrum this can be written as
%
\be
C_{\ell,ij} = C_{\ell,ij}^\textrm{II} + C_{\ell_ij}^\textrm{IG} + C_{\ell_ij}^\textrm{GI}+ C_{\ell_ij}^\textrm{GG}\;.
\tag{IA.3}
\label{eq:IA.3}
\ee
%
Assuming that the $j$ redshift bin is more distant that the $i$ redshift bin the correlation IG should be zero, except in 
the case that galaxy redshifts are incorrect or there are systematic effects in the data. The remaining three terms are described as follows 
\begin{enumerate}
\item GG is the gravitational-gravitational or shear-shear correlation between two galaxies. This is the 
cosmic shear that surveys tend to measure, which is the gravitational lensing of a distant source galaxy by the gravitational matter field of the lens. 
\item GI is the gravitational-intrinsic or shape-shear correlation, which 
is the correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity of one galaxy with the shear of another galaxy. This 
happens when a foreground galaxy ellipticity is correlated via IA to structure of the lens that 
shears a background galaxy. A lens causes background galaxies to be aligned tangentially while galaxies 
physically close to the lens are stretched radially towards the lens due to tidal forces. This produces a negative GI correlation. 
\item II is the intrinsic-intrinsic or shape-shape correlation of two galaxies. This is 
only for the galaxies that are physically close and share the same local environment; as the 
formation of galaxies and their orientation is highly affected by the tidal force of the local environment. 
\end{enumerate}
The contamination due to II can be reduced by removing galaxy pairs at the same 
redshift \citep{2003MNRAS.339..711H,2002A&A...396..411K,2003A&A...398...23K}. The GI 
contribution is harder to remove since galaxy pairs at the same line-of-sight at all angles are affected. 
The contribution due to GI can be reduced in a model-independent way 
within the survey \citep{2008A&A...477...43J,2009A&A...507..105J}, or can be modelled 
and its effect then removed \citep{2005A&A...441...47K,2010A&A...523A...1J}. Each of the methods 
have advantages and disadvantages. 
\\
\\
There are various models for the intrinsic alignment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Linear alignment model describes the local alignment, or orientation of their semi-major axis, of galaxies due to interactions with their local tidal gravitational field. The model predicts that the ellipticity of 
galaxy is a linear function of the tidal quadrupole. This is normally applied to elliptical galaxies. 
The model is applicable on large scales (i.e. $\gtrsim 30$ Mpc). 
In the model the intrinsic ellipticity of a galaxy is assumed to follow the linear relation
%
\be
e = \frac{C_1}{4\pi G}\left( \nabla^2_x - \nabla^2_y \; , \; 2\nabla_x \nabla_y \right) \; \mathcal{S}[\Psi_P] \; ,
\tag{IA.4}
\label{eq:IA.4}
\ee
%
where $\Psi_P$ is the Newtonian potential at the time of galaxy formation, $\mathcal{S}$ is a smoothing filter that cuts off fluctuations on galactic scales, $\nabla$ is a comoving derivative and $C_1$ is a normalisation constant. The model is described in \cite{2001MNRAS.320L...7C,2004PhRvD..70f3526H,2010PhRvD..82d9901H} 
\item Quadratic alignment model describes the local alignment of galaxies, or orientation of their semi-major axis, due to interactions with their local tidal gravitational field. The model predicts that the 
ellipticity of a galaxy is a quadratic function of the tidal field. This is normally applied to spiral 
galaxies because it is hypothesised that the angular momentum of the spiral galaxy during 
gravitational collapse should influence its orientation. The model requires two tidal quadrupoles 
to describe the orientation. The model is described in \cite{2010PhRvD..82d9901H}

this defines the position of the light ray in the source plane. 
Gravitational lensing by fluctuations in the matter or energy density shifts $\vec\beta$ to a new direction 
$\vec\theta$, which is the position of the deflected light ray in the lens plane. 
We denote by $\vec\alpha(\vec\theta):=\vec\theta-\vec\beta(\vec\theta)$ as the deflection angle of a

\newcommand\pixel{
Pixel can refer to a physical object or be used in a grammatic sense in weak lensing literature
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
This is a defined area on the surface of a CCD within which the flux of photons is summed over some 
time-period (defined by the electronics and software of the CCDs and imaging system of a telescope). Pixels are 
typically square or rectangular -- although there sensitivity can become slightly non-square due to electrons and 
electric fields leaking or interfering between neighbouring pixels. In a rendered image pixels are represented by square or 
rectangular areas of brightness. 
\item 
Pixel can also be used as a prefix in weak lensing, for example ``pixel effect'' would refer 
to an effect caused by the fact that images are rendered in pixels; ``pixel noise'' \citep{2012MNRAS.424.2757M} refers to the noise 
in images that have been rendered in pixels; from a combination of sources. Pixelisation refers 
to the process of an objects image being rendered in pixels

\dictentry{dictionary}{Pointing}{
A pointing is an area of sky from which observations have been taken in sequence. For example a single 
pointing --- or one pointing --- may contain multiple exposures (or only one exposure). 
The word refers to the physical act of pointing the telescope at an area of sky. 
If an area of sky is revisited in a non-sequential way, i.e. at a later time between which other observations 
have been made, this would be referred to as multi-epoch imaging where each pointing

\newcommand\Alignment{
In weak lensing this can refer to several different physical effects depending on the context 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Galaxy alignment refers to the 3D orientation of the semi-major axis of a 
galaxy -- characterised by its stellar distribution -- with respect
to some direction.
\item In weak lensing images we observe the projected shapes of galaxies and in this context galaxy alignment refers 
to the observed apparent 2D projected alignment of a galaxy's observed surface
brightness distribution with respect to some direction.
\item Intrinsic alignment refers to the phenomenon that the semi-major axes of a galaxy's stellar distribution may 
exhibit a tendency to be aligned with the local dark matter
over-densities. This is a physical effect, distinct from the previous item which is an observed alignment. 
\item In particular contexts alignment can also refer to the weak lensing shear. For example, around galaxy 
clusters background galaxies tend to be tangentially aligned, due to the weak lensing effect of the cluster. 
\item Alignment can also refer to instrumental properties where a particular aspect of a physical object 
in an instrument or telescope has a degree of freedom which is correlated, or points towards, a particular 
coordinate. For example a mirror may be aligned with the optical axes of a telescope

\dictentry{dictionary}{E/B-mode Shear}{
A\index{E- and B-modes of a shear
      field}\index{Shear $\gamma$!E/B-mode decomposition} general
    spin-2 field, such as 
    shear $\gamma(\vec\theta)$, can be decomposed into E-modes,
    B-modes, and ambiguous modes. If the shear field is caused by a
    (geometrically-thin) gravitational lens, its two Cartesian
    components are given as second-order partial derivatives of the
    deflection potential $\psi$ -- see Eq.\,(\ref{eq:WLE.10}); hence,
    these two components are mutually related. Introducing the complex
    nabla operator $\nabla_{\rm c}:=\partial/\partial\theta_1 + {\rm i}
\partial/\partial\theta_2$, the shear produced by a lens can be
written as $\gamma=\nabla_{\rm c}\nabla_{\rm c}\psi/2$, and the
Poisson equation (\ref{eq:WLE.6}) becomes $\kappa=\nabla^*_{\rm
  c}\nabla_{\rm c}\psi/2$. The local relation (\ref{eq:WLE.18}) between
the gradient of $\kappa$ and the derivatives of the shear reads
$\nabla_{\rm c}\kappa=\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma$. Taking another
derivative, we find $\nabla_{\rm c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}\kappa
=\nabla_{\rm c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma$. Since the Laplacian
$\nabla_{\rm c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}$ and $\kappa$ are both real, the
imaginary component of $\nabla_{\rm c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma$
vanishes for a shear field due to a gravitational lens.
\\
\\
A general shear field $\gamma(\vec\theta)$ does not have this
property. If a shear field is caused by a lens, meaning that there
exists a real scalar function $\psi^{\rm E}$ such that $\gamma=\nabla_{\rm
c}\nabla_{\rm c}\psi^{\rm E}/2$, it is called an `E-mode' shear field. In
particular, for an E-mode field, the imaginary part of $\nabla_{\rm
c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma$ vanishes identically. A pure B-mode shear
field is obtained from a real scalar function $\psi^{\rm B}$ through
$\gamma={\rm i}\nabla_{\rm
c}\nabla_{\rm c}\psi^{\rm B}/2$, for which the real component of $\nabla_{\rm
c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma$ vanishes identically. A general shear
field is the superposition of both, and can be written as 
$\gamma=\nabla_{\rm
c}\nabla_{\rm c}\rund{\psi^{\rm E}+{\rm i}\psi^{\rm B}}/2$.
There also exist ambiguous modes: For a shear field which is a linear
function of position, $\nabla_{\rm c}^*\nabla_{\rm c}^*\gamma\equiv
0$; hence, such a linear shear field can be either attributed to
E-modes or to B-modes. If a shear field has a B-mode contribution, the
result of the mass reconstruction relation (\ref{eq:WLE.17}) yields an
imaginary component for $\kappa$.
\\
\\
A division of the shear into E-, B-, and ambiguous modes also must be
considered for second- and higher-order shear statistics
({\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Cosmic Shear}}).

$\vec\ell$, valid for $\vec\ell\ne \vec 0$. For $\ell=\vec 0$, the
relation between $\tilde\gamma$ and $\tilde\kappa$ is undefined,
related to the fact that a uniform convergence yields no shear. These
relations can be inverted,

which forms the basis of mass reconstructions from weak lensing data;
here, $\kappa_0$ is an undetermined additive constant. 
For a general shear field, e.g., if the shear field is estimated from
noisy data, the result of the integral in (\ref{eq:WLE.17}) may have an
imaginary component. This is related to the E/B-modes of a general
shear field ({\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{E/B-mode Shear}}).
Therefore, for practical purposes, one takes the
real part of the integral.
A local

provided by

where $K(\vec\theta)=-\ln[1-\kappa(\vec\theta)]$. The latter
equation shows that from an estimate of the reduced shear, $(1-\kappa)$
can be determined only up to a multiplicative constant.

Assuming the applicability of the linearised lens equation,
the surface brightness of the image follows from (\ref{eq:WLE.8}),
%
\be
  I(\vec\theta) = I^{(\rm s)}\left[
    \vec\beta_0+\mathcal{A}(\vec\theta_0)
    \cdot(\vec\theta-\vec\theta_0)
  \right]\;.
\tag{WLE.19}
\label{eq:WLE.19}
\ee
%
For larger images for which the linearised lens equation no longer
provides an accurate approximation, higher-order expansions of the
lens equation need to be considered ({\scshape{\footnotesize see}
  \gls{Flexion}}). The flux of an image $S$ is obtained by integrating the
surface brightness $I(\vec\theta)$ over $\vec\theta$, and is related
to the flux $S_0$ of the unlensed source through $S=|\mu|S_0$. The
{\it magnification}\index{Magnification} (for an infinitesimally small
source) $\mu_{\rm p}$ is 
obtained from the distortion matrix 
(\ref{eq:WLE.9}), 
%
\be
\mu_{\rm p}={1\over \det{\cal A}}={1\over (1-\kappa)^2-|\gamma|^2}
={1\over (1-\kappa)^2(1-|g|^2)}\;.
\tag{WLE.20}
\label{eq:WLE.20}
\ee
%
The sign of $\mu_{\rm p}$ is called the \index{Parity of lensed
images}{\it parity of an image}. Strong lenses can have regions with
negative parity. Curves in the lens plane on which $\mu_{\rm p}=0$ are
called \index{Critical curves}{\it critical curves}; they form in
general closed, smooth curves. Mapping critical curves onto the source
plane through the lens equation yields the \index{Caustics}{\it
caustics}; these are in general also closed curves which are smooth
except for a finite number of \index{Cusps}{\it cusps} where the
tangent vector of the caustic vanishes . The divergence of $\mu_{\rm
p}$ on a critical curve is just a formal one; for sources of finite
extent, the linearised lens equation fails at critical curves, and the
magnification of real (finite) sources, obtained by averaging the
point-source magnification $|\mu_{\rm p}|$ weighted by the surface
brightness, remains finite. In weak lensing, where $\kappa\ll 1$ and
$|\gamma|\ll 1$, $\mu_{\rm p}$ is positive and close to unity.
\\
\\
If the lensing effect of a generic 3-dimensional matter distribution is
considered (as in the case of lensing by the large-scale matter
distribution in the Universe -- {\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Cosmic
  Shear}}), one needs to refer to the laws of light propagation in a
curved space-time. This is governed by the {\it equation of geodesic
deviation} ({\scshape{\footnotesize see} \gls{Geodesic Deviation Equation}}).
We now specialize Eq.\,(\ref{eq:GDE.2}) to a
perturbed \index{Metric of a perturbed Friedman--Robertson--Walker model}Friedman--Robertson--Walker metric of the form
%
\be
  \d s^2 = a^2(\tau)\left[
    \left(1+\frac{2\Phi_{\rm N}}{c^2}\right)\,c^2\d\tau^2-
    \left(1-\frac{2\Phi_{\rm N}}{c^2}\right)
    \left(\d \chi^2+f_K^2(\chi)\d\omega^2\right)
  \right]\;,
\tag{WLE.21}
\label{eq:WLE.21}
\ee
%
where $\chi$ is the comoving radial distance ({\scshape{\footnotesize
    see} \gls{Friedman--Robertson--Walker Models}}), $a=(1+z)^{-1}$ the
scale factor, 
$\tau$ is the \index{Conformal time}conformal time, related to the cosmic
time $t$ through $\d t=a(t)\;\d \tau$, $f_K(\chi)$ is the comoving
angular diameter 
distance, and $\Phi_{\rm N}(\vec x,\chi)$
denotes the Newtonian peculiar gravitational potential which depends on the
comoving position $\vec x$ and cosmic time (or comoving distance $\chi$).
In this metric, the tidal matrix ${\cal T}$ can be calculated in terms of the
Newtonian potential $\Phi_{\rm N}$, and correspondingly,
the equation of geodesic deviation (\ref{eq:GDE.1})
yields the evolution equation for the comoving separation vector $\vec
x(\vec\theta,\chi)$ of a ray in a ray bundle, specified by the angle
$\vec\theta$ from the fiducial ray at the vertex, located at the 
observer, 
%
\be
\frac{\d^2\vec x}{\d \chi^2} +
K\,\vec x = -\frac{2}{c^2} \eck{ \nabla_\perp\Phi_{\rm N}\rund{\vec

\tag{WLE.22}
\label{eq:WLE.22}
\ee
%
with $\vec x(\vec\theta,0)=\vec 0$ and $(\d\vec
x/\d\chi)(\vec\theta,0)=\vec\theta$,  
where $K=(H_0/c)^2\,(\Omega_{\rm tot}-1)$ is the spatial curvature of
the Universe, $\nabla_\perp=(\partial/\partial x_1,\partial/\partial
x_2)$ is the transverse {\it comoving} gradient operator, and
$\Phi^{(0)}_{\rm N}(\chi)$ is the potential along the fiducial ray.
The solution of the homogeneous version of Eq.\, (\ref{eq:WLE.22})
yields the comoving angular-diameter distance $f_K(\chi)$ (see
Eq.\,\ref{eq:FRW.2}). The
formal solution of Eq.\,(\ref{eq:WLE.22}) is obtained by the method of Green's
function, to yield
%
\be
  \vec x(\vec\theta,\chi) = f_K(\chi)\vec\theta - 
  \frac{2}{c^2}\!\int_0^\chi\!\!\! \d \chi'\,f_K(\chi-\chi')\! 
  \eck{ \nabla_\perp\Phi_{\rm N}\rund{\vec
x(\vec\theta,\chi'),\chi'} -\nabla_\perp\Phi_{\rm N}^{(0)}\rund{\chi'}} .
\tag{WLE.23}
\label{eq:WLE.23}
\ee
%
A source at comoving distance $\chi$ with comoving separation $\vec x$
from the fiducial light ray would be seen, in the absence of light
deflection, at the angular separation $\vec \beta=\vec x/f_K(\chi)$
from the fiducial ray (this statement is nothing but the definition of
the comoving angular diameter distance).  Hence, $\vec\beta$ is the
unlensed angular position in the `comoving source plane' at distance
$\chi$, relative to that of the fiducial ray.  Therefore, in analogy with
standard lens theory, we define the Jacobi matrix\index{Distortion
  matrix ${\cal A}$!for a 3-D matter distribution}\index{Jacobi matrix of the
  lens equation!for a 3-D
  matter distribution} 
%
\be
{\cal A}(\vec\theta,\chi)={\partial\vec \beta\over\partial\vec\theta}
={1\over f_K(\chi)}{\partial\vec x\over\partial\vec\theta}\;,
\tag{WLE.24}
\label{eq:WLE.24}

%
and obtain from (\ref{eq:WLE.23})
%
\be
{\cal A}_{ij}(\vec\theta,\chi)=\delta_{ij}-\frac{2}{c^2}\int_0^\chi \!\! \d\chi'\,
{f_K(\chi-\chi') f_K(\chi')\over f_K(\chi)}\,\Phi_{{\rm N},ik}\rund{\vec

\tag{WLE.25}
\label{eq:WLE.25}
\ee
%
which describes the locally linearised mapping introduced by LSS
lensing. This equation still is exact in the limit of validity of the
weak-field metric, and the pair of Eqs.\, (\ref{eq:WLE.23}) and
(\ref{eq:WLE.25}) are followed typically in ray-tracing
simulations\index{Ray-tracingsimulations} 
\citep[e.g.,][and references
therein]{2000ApJ...530..547J,2009A&A...499...31H}.
\\
\\
Expanding ${\cal A}$ in powers of $\Phi_{\rm N}/c^2$, and truncating the
series after the linear term yields
%
\be
{\cal A}_{ij}(\vec\theta,\chi)
=\delta_{ij}-\frac{2}{c^2}\int_0^\chi \!\! \d \chi'\,
{f_K(\chi-\chi') f_K(\chi')\over f_K(\chi)}\,
\Phi_{{\rm N},ij}\rund{f_K(\chi')\vec\theta,\chi'} \;,
\tag{WLE.26}
\label{eq:WLE.26}
\ee
%
and provides two essential simplification compared to
Eq.\,(\ref{eq:WLE.25}): First, the distortion is obtained by integrating
along the unperturbed ray $\vec x=f_K(\chi)\,\vec\theta$; this is also
called the \index{Born approximation}{\it Born approximation}. Second, in (\ref{eq:WLE.25}), the
matrix product in the integrand yields a coupling of tidal field
matrices $\Phi_{{\rm N},ij}$ at different distances $\chi'$, which
disappears in the linear version (\ref{eq:WLE.26}), rendering ${\cal A}$
symmetric. This approximation is frequently referred to as
\index{Lens-lens coupling}`neglecting
lens-lens coupling'. In the literature, one often sees both
approximations as being collectively called `Born approximation'.
Corrections to the Born approximation are necessarily of order
$\Phi_{\rm N}^2/c^2$ \citep[see][and references therein for
higher-order terms]{2010A&A...523A..28K}.
\\
\\
Employing the Born approximation from here on, we now define the
deflection potential
%
\be
\psi(\vec\theta,\chi):=\frac{2}{c^2}\int_0^\chi \!\! \d \chi'\,
{f_K(\chi-\chi') \over f_K(\chi)\;f_K(\chi')}\,
\Phi_{\rm N}\rund{f_K(\chi')\vec\theta,\chi'} \;,
\tag{WLE.27}
\label{eq:WLE.27}
\ee
%
yielding ${\cal A}_{ij}=\delta_{ij}-\psi_{,ij}$, just as in
geometrically-thin lens theory. 
In this approximation, lensing by the 3-D matter
distribution can be treated as an \index{Equivalent lens
  plane}equivalent lens plane with 
deflection potential $\psi$, convergence $\kappa=\nabla^2\psi/2$, and
shear $\gamma=(\psi_{,11}-\psi_{,22})/2+{\rm i}\psi_{,12}$.
\\
\\
One can relate $\kappa$ to fractional density contrast $\delta$ of
matter fluctuations in the Universe by using the Poisson equation, 
to yield\index{Convergence $\kappa$!for 3-D lensing}
%
\be
\kappa(\vec\theta,\chi)=\frac{3H_0^2\Omega_{\rm m}}{2c^2}\,
  \int_0^\chi\,\d \chi'\,\frac{f_K(\chi')f_K(\chi-\chi')}{f_K(\chi)}\,
  \frac{\delta\rund{f_K(\chi')\vec\theta,\chi'}}{a(\chi')}\;.
\tag{WLE.28}
\label{eq:WLE.28}
\ee
%
Note that $\kappa$ is proportional to $\Omega_{\rm m}$, since lensing is
sensitive to $\Delta\rho\propto \Omega_{\rm m}\,\delta$, not just to
the density contrast $\delta=\Delta\rho/\bar\rho$ itself.
An equivalent expression for the convergence reads\index{Convergence
  $\kappa$!for 3-D lensing} 
%
\be
\kappa(\vec\theta,z_{\rm s})=\int_0^{z_{\rm s}} \d z\;
{\d D_{\rm prop}\over \d z}\;
{4\pi G\over c^2}\,
{D_{\rm A}(z) D_{\rm A}(z,z_{\rm s})\over D_{\rm A}(z_{\rm s})}\,
\Delta\rho(D_{\rm A}(z)\vec\theta,z)\;,
\tag{WLE.29}
\label{eq:WLE.29}
\ee
%
which has an immediate intuitive interpretation: the density contrast
$\Delta\rho = \rho-\bar\rho$ (as a function of proper transverse
separation $D_{\rm A}(z)\vec\theta$)
as the source of the gravitational field,
multiplied by the proper distance interval $\d D_{\rm prop}$, yields a
surface mass density $\d\Sigma$ at redshift $z$, which is multiplied
by the inverse of the critical surface density in the integrand,
resulting in an infinitesimal convergence $\d\kappa$ at redshift
$z$. The convergence is then obtained by line-of-sight integration
of this infinitesimal convergence. If $\delta\rho$ is assumed to be
non-zero only on a small redshift interval centred on $z_{\rm d}$,
the convergence of the geometrically-thin lens equation (\ref{eq:WLE.4})
is reobtained.
\\
\\
For a redshift (or distance) distribution of sources with $p_z(z)\,\d
z=p_\chi(\chi)\,\d \chi$, 
the effective surface mass density becomes
\be
\kappa(\vec\theta)=\int\d \chi\;p_\chi(\chi)\,\kappa(\vec\theta,\chi)
= \frac{3H_0^2\Omega_{\rm m}}{2c^2}\,
  \int_0^{\chi_{\rm h}}\d \chi\;g_{\rm LE}(\chi)\,f_K(\chi)\,

which is the source-redshift weighted lens efficiency factor
$D_{\rm ds}/D_{\rm s}$ for a

homogeneity ensures that the correlator depends only on the separation

The Friedman equation (\ref{eq:FRW.10}) is a first-order differential
equation for $a(t)$, and its solution is specified by the current
expansion rate $H_0$. Classifying the general properties of its
solutions in terms of the density parameters, together with
lower limits on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ obtained from cosmological
observations, yields the result that $a\to 0$ at a finite time in the
past. That epoch is called \index{Big Bang}{\it Big Bang}. Relics of
the Big Bang, such as the helium abundance in the Universe and the
existence of the cosmicmicrowave background, confirm this prediction
of the cosmological model.

The \index{Cosmological redshift}{\it cosmological redshift} $z$ of a
comoving source seen by a 
comoving observer today
is related to the scale factor through
$(1+z)=1/a$. The scale factor at which the energy density of matter
and radiation are equal is $a_{\rm eq}={\Omega_{\rm r} / \Omega_{\rm
    m}}$, corresponding to the \index{Redshift of matter-radiation
  equality $z_{\rm eq}$}{\it redshift of matter-radiation
  equality} $z_{\rm eq}=a_{\rm eq}^{-1}-1$.\footnote{Health warning: Cosmologists
  often use the same symbol for meaning totally different mathematical
  functions. For example, they write $H(a)$ to mean the function given
  in (\ref{eq:FRW.10}), but also write $H(z)$ to imply the function
  obtained from $H(a)$ by replacing $a$ by $(1+z)^{-1}$. of course,
  this yields a {\it mathematically} very different function, but
  usually no confusion arises by this practice.}

From the metric (\ref{eq:FRW.1}) we see that the comoving
angular-diameter distance $f_K$ is the ratio of the comoving
transverse extent of an object, $f_K(\chi)\,\d\theta$ and the angle
$\d\theta$ as observed by an observer at $\chi=0$.  The {\it angular
diameter distance}\index{Angular-diameter distance!in an FRW model
$D_A$} $D_{\rm A}(z)$ out to redshift $z$ relates the 
physical size $\d R=a(t)\,f_K(\chi)\,\d\theta$ of a comoving object to
its angular size $\d\theta$ on the sky, $D_{\rm A}=\d R/\d\theta$. It
is thus related to the comoving angular diameter $f_K$ though $D_{\rm
A}(z)=a\, f_K(\chi)=(1+z)^{-1}\,f_K(\chi)$. 
\\

The angular-diameter distance of a source at redshift $z_2$ seen by an
observer along the same line-of-sight at redshift $z_1<z_2$ is given
as 
%
\be
D_{\rm A}(z_1,z_2)={1\over 1+z_2}\,f_k(\chi_2-\chi_1) \;,

where $\chi_i$ is the comoving distance out to redshift $z_i$.

The luminosity distance\index{Luminosity distance}
$D_{\rm L}(z)$ yields the relation between the bolometric luminosity
$L$ of an isotropically radiating comoving source at redshift $z$ to
the observed bolometric flux $S$,

\be
D_{\rm L}(z)\equiv \sqrt{L\over 4\pi S}\;.

For any metric theory of gravity, $D_{\rm L}(z)=(1+z)^2 D_{\rm

The comoving distance $\chi$ of a source as a function of
its cosmological redshift is obtained from (\ref{eq:FRW.3}) and
(\ref{eq:FRW.4}),\index{Comoving distance!asfunction of redshift}

Since the speed of light is finite, light can only propagate a finite
distance from the Big Bang until a given epoch. This distance is
called {\it horizon}. The comoving horizon size at redshift $z$ is

\dictentry{review}{Structure Formation in the Universe}{\sfm}
\newcommand\sfm{
The formation
 of structure in the Universe is a complex 
research field that cannot be described in the framework of this
document. Here, we provide the basic quantities for the simplest case,
namely the growth of density perturbations of pressureless matter on
scales smaller than the horizon scale.
\\
\\
In the framework of an inhomogeneous universe, the mean density of
matter as function of epoch is denoted by $\bar{\rho}_{\rm m}(t)$ (or with
scale factor $a$, redshift $z$, or comoving distance $\chi$ as
argument). The \index{Fractional matter density contrast $\delta_{\rm
    m}$}fractional matter density contrast is defined as  
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\renewcommand{\theHequation}{\arabic{equation}}
%
\be
\delta_{\rm m}(\vec x,t):={\rho_{\rm m}(\vec x,t)-\bar{\rho}_{\rm m}(t)\over
\bar{\rho}_{\rm m}(t)}\;,
\tag{LSS.1}
\label{eq:LSS.1}
\ee
%
where $\vec x$ is the comoving spatial position, and the
\index{Peculiar velocity}peculiar
velocity is denoted by $\vec v(\vec x,t)$. Describing the behaviour of
the matter field using the fluid approximation, and neglecting
pressure (which is a valid approximation for describing (cold) dark
matter in the epochs of the Universe
for which $a\gg a_{\rm eq}=\Omega_{\rm r}/\Omega_{\rm m}\ll 1$, as
long as the density contrast $\delta_{\rm m}\lesssim 1$), one obtains
the coupled set of continuity equation, pressure-less Euler equation,
and Poisson equation, 
%
\be
{\partial \delta_{\rm m} \over \partial t}+{1\over
  a}\nabla\cdot\eck{(1+\delta_{\rm m})\vec v}=0 \; ; \quad
{\partial \vec v\over \partial t}+{\dot a\over a}\vec v+{1\over a}\rund{\vec
v\cdot \nabla} \vec v=-{1\over a}\nabla \Phi_{\rm N} \; ; \quad
\nabla^2\Phi_{\rm N} ={3 H_0^2 \Omega_{\rm m} \over 2 a}\delta_{\rm m} \;,
\tag{LSS.2}
\label{eq:LSS.2}
\ee
%
where the spatial derivatives are with respect to comoving coordinates
$\vec x$, and $\dot a\equiv \d a/\d t$. Assuming the fraction density
contrast to be small, $|\delta_{\rm m}|\ll 1$, this set of equations
can be linearized in $\delta_{\rm m}$ and $|\vec v|/c$, and then
combined into a single equation,
%
\be
\frac{\partial^2{\delta_{\rm m}}}{\partial t^2}
+{2\dot a\over a}{\partial \delta_{\rm m}\over \partial t}-{3 H_0^2 \Omega_{\rm
m} \over 2 a^3 } \delta_{\rm m} = 0\;.
\tag{LSS.3}
\label{eq:LSS.3}
\ee
%
Since the coefficients of this partial differential equation have no
dependence on $\vec x$, its solution can then be factorized,
$\delta_{\rm m}(\vec x,t)=D_+(t)\,\Delta_+(\vec x)+D_-(t)\,\Delta_-(\vec x)$,
where the $\Delta_\pm(\vec x)$ are arbitrary functions of $\vec x$, to be
determined from the initial conditions, and 
$D_\pm(t)$ satisfy the ordinary differential equation
%
\be
\ddot{D} + \frac{2 \dot{a}}{a} \dot{D} = \frac{3 H_0^2 \Omega_{\rm
m}}{2 a^3}\, D \;.
\tag{LSS.4}
\label{eq:LSS.4}
\ee
%
$D_-$ is a decreasing function of time, thus these modes decay during
cosmic evolution. The solution $D_+$, called the \index{Growth factor
  $D_+$}{\it growth factor}, 
inceases in time and hence 
describes the growth of density fluctuations. It is normalized to
unity today, $D_+(t_0)=1$. If the dark energy is described by a
cosmological constant, then
%
\be
D_+(t)\propto{H(t)  H_0^2}\int^t_0 {\d t'\over a^2(t') H^2(t')} \;,\quad
\hbox{or}\quad
D_+(a)\propto {H(a)\over H_0}\int_0^a {\d a' \over \eck{\Omega_{\rm m}/a'
+\Omega_\Lambda a'^2-(\Omega_{\rm m}+\Omega_\Lambda-1)}^{3/2}}\;.
\tag{LSS.5}
\label{eq:LSS.5}
\ee
%
The solution $\delta_{\rm m}(\vec x,t)=D_+(t)\delta_{\rm m,0}(\vec
x)$, where $\delta_{\rm m,0}(\vec x)$ is the {\it linearly
  extrapolated density contrast today}, with the function $D_+(t)$
being the growing solution of Eq.\,(\ref{eq:LSS.4}), is valid only for
subhorizon perturbations in
the matter-dominated epoch ($a\gg a_{\rm eq}$). Superhorizon
perturbations grow $\propto a$ for $a\gg a_{\rm eq}$, which is the same
behavior as $D_+$ for epochs where matter dominates over the dark
energy and the curvature term in the Friedman eqation (\ref{eq:FRW.10}).
In the radiation-dominated epoch ($a\ll a_{\rm eq}$), superhorizon
fluctuations grow $\propto a^2$, whereas subhorizon matter
fluctuations are stalled: their amplitude stays constant. In fact, for
sub-horizon fluctuations one finds $\delta_{\rm m}\propto
\rund{1+a_{\rm eq}^{-1}a}$. This different growth behavior of super-
and subhorizon scale fluctuations in the radiation-dominated epoch
suppresses density fluctuations on scales smaller than  the comoving
horizon scale at matter-radiation 
equality, $r_{\rm H,com}(a_{\rm eq})$ (see Eq.\,\ref{eq:FRW.15}), called
\index{M\'esz\'aros effect}M\'esz\'aros effect. Furthermore, the
growth of structure is affected by the presence of baryons in the epoch
before recombination ($z\gtrsim 1000$), since the ionized baryon fluid
is strongly coupled to the photons and together form a
pressure-dominated fluid in which \index{Baryonic acoustic
osciallations}{\it baryonic acoustic osciallations} develop. In
addition, the presence of neutinos (or other forms of \index{Hot dark
matter}hot dark matter) can suppress structure growth due to
free-streaming of fast particles.

If $\tilde\delta_{\rm m}(\vec k,t)$ denotes  the Fourier transform of
$\delta_{\rm m}(\vec x,t)$, where $\vec k$ is the comoving wave
vector, then
%
\be
\ave{\tilde\delta_{\rm m}(\vec k,t)\,\tilde\delta_{\rm m}(\vec k',t)}
=(2\pi)^3\,\delta_{\rm D}(\vec k + \vec k')\,P_{\rm m}(|\vec k|,t)\;,

where the Dirac delta `function' is due to the assumed statistical
homogeneity of the density field, and the \index{Matter power
spectrum}{\it matter power spectrum} $P_{\rm m}$ depends only on the
absolute value of $\vec k$, owing to the assumed statistical isotropy.
\\
\\
The primordial power spectrum as predicted from simple inflationary
models follows a power law, $P_{\rm m}\propto k^{n_{\rm s}}$, where
the \index{Spectral index of primordial fluctuations $n_{\rm

to be slightly less than unity.  In the framework of linear
perturbation theory, the matter power spectrum then becomes

$T_k$}{\it transfer function $T_k$} accounts for the M\'esz\'aros
effect, the presence of baryonic acoustic oscillations and the effects
of hot dark matter and can be obtained from solving the linearized
coupled Boltzmann equations for the various components (cold dark

Friedman--Robertson--Walker metric (\ref{eq:WLE.21}); there are publicly
available codes for obtaining accurate transfer functions (see e.g. \citep{1999ApJ...511....5E}).}
